# Godot Test Projects and Code Snippets

This repository is primarily used for testing purposes and sharing code related to Godot PRs. Itâ€™s a collection of test projects and code snippets I use to validate my own PRs and contributions to the Godot Engine. The content here is inconsistent, not suitable for production, and not meant for general exploration.
